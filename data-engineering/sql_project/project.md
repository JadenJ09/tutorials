### Project 1.
Build A Menu For Bytes Of China
A new restaurant, Bytes of China, has just moved to a busy street in Chinatown from a previous location. Bytes of China has hired you to design its database schema so that it can display its menu on its new website, It has provided you with a copy of its current menu.

### Project 2.
Building an Inventory Database with PostgreSQL
In this project you’ll build out a database schema that could be used to organize an inventory of mechanical parts. This schema will keep track of all the parts, their manufacturer, category, location in storeroom, available inventory, and other relevant information.

A database like this might be updated and queried by an inventory management application that accepts input from many users who might not be familiar with the database structure. As a result, we should make sure that there are sufficient data quality checks to ensure that only valid data can be entered into the database.

We’ll start with tables with just a few constraints and build upon them throughout the project. Press 'Start' to begin inspecting the data.

### Project 3.
Calculating Churn Rates
Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks you to look into subscription churn rates. It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.

The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide you with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.

### Project 4.
Attribution Queries
CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns. This project will guide you through some of that process.

At this point you should have taken the lesson on touch attribution. This project will guide you through a number of queries on CoolTShirts’ user data (see the schema here).

Check off the steps as you go. In the rare chance that your project gets stuck in a bad state — maybe you accidentally edited the data —, refresh the page.

### Project 5.
Analyze Twitch Gaming Data
Twitch

Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with 15 million daily active users. Using data to understand its users and products is one of the main responsibilities of the Twitch Data Science Team.

In this project, you will be working with two tables that contain Twitch users’ stream viewing data and chat room usage data.
